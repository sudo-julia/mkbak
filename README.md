# mkbak.py

`mkbak` is a commandline utility to find files and create backups accordingly.  
It interfaces with `fzf` when finding the files, allowing you to interactively
select what to back up.

## Installation

`pip install --user -U mkbak`

## Usage

- Run `mkbak` to start recursively searching for files to backup
from your current directory
- For all options, run `mkbak --help`

Please note that the `--height` argument will be overridden if set to '100' and
the environment variable `$FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` contains `--height` set to something
other than '100'

## Example

- `mkbak -vi --path "$folder" -q 'pdf$'`
will launch mkbak searching `$folder`
, query files ending in 'pdf', ignore case distinctions in file names and
print out any errors along with files successfully copied

## Requirements

- [mkbak-iterfzf](https://github.com/sudo-julia/mkbak-iterfzf)
for the fzf interface
- [rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) for formatting with `--verbose`
- Python^3.7
- Linux
